## "The thing is broken" or "Site wont build"
Hey Bob, sorry to hear about the trouble. Let's try and track down the issue here but first lets double check a few things first and see if we can get a quick win. First can you check to see what build command you are using? Each Static Site Generator has their own and it may be something different then the provided suggestions during setup. Also Each Static Site Generator has it's own output build directory so check it's docs just to make sure that is set correctly.

With those out of the way, if you could send me the answers to the following that will be a huge help:
* Which Static Site Generator are you using?
* What is the output of the build log?
* Can you share with me the link to your repository?
* Lastly just to be sure, what build command and what output build directory is set?

Also There are some links that might help you out:
* Tutorials at <a href="https://www.netlify.com/tags/tutorial/" target="_blank"> Netlify Tutorials</a>
* Docs at <a href="https://www.netlify.com/docs/" target="_blank"> Netlify Docs</a>

Hope this helps!
