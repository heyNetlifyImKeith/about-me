## SSL/HTTPS and you.

HTTPwha? HTTPS, that is right S for Secure. In today's world I would say most of us have done some kind of transaction online. We transfer money, addresses, Social Security numbers and all kinds of sensitive information. Did you know hackers can "sniff" out these packets and intercept them if your not on a secure connection? Not only that but your ISP can even inject information into your headers to show you adds or collect data. It is time that you start checking your connection is encrypted by checking to make sure you have added that S to your http url.

Now even if you do not make those transactions or put any sensitive information online. Do you have your own site? Did you know that Google gives your page a bump in rankings if it is using https? Did you know that some browsers will send its users a warning before accessing your page if your site is not secure? There are multiple reasons why you should update your page to https and with services like "Let's Encrypt" you can get those SSL certifications for free!
