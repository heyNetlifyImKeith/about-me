## DNS configuration and why it can be difficult.
You just bought a brand new shiny domain. Now what? I think a lot of folks get stuck in the situation where you have bought a name but your site is hosted through another service. Every Domain Registrar has their on DNS server and their own location within their site to hold or manage that information. I think the hardest part about DNS configuration is just locating the right docs for your Registrar as well as your host.

The issue can be especially frustrating if you are just winging it. Lets say you have found a tutorial or some docs but they are out dated. You think you have entered all the information and followed along correctly. The issue is these changes are not instant so the feedback on if it is configured correctly can be a few hours or day away.
