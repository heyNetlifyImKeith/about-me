It was hard to choose from the list of tasks of which I enjoy as well as dislike. The first reason being there is definitely more than 5 of those tasks I will enjoy. The second being it was hard to come up with 5 that I would consider not enjoyable.

## Things I definitely enjoy

* Submit bug reports and potentially bug fixes to closed and open source projects that Netlify maintains on GitHub.
* Set up your own copy of several static site frameworks for debugging.
* Engage multiple users at once via chat to answer their questions and troubleshoot problems.
* Work with the development team to help design a new feature based on feedback from customers.
* Help train and onboard new support teammates.

## Things that might take time to grow on me.

* Deliver a talk to many people you don't know at a conference or meetup.
* Find and recruit teammates for the support team.
* Manage a support team.
* Write and maintain documentation for our software and blog posts for our website.
* Create video tutorials to help teach users a specific feature or use case.
