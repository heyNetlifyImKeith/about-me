## <a href="https://developers.digitalocean.com/documentation/oauth/" target="_blank">Digital Ocean Docs</a>

Digital Ocean has fantastic documentation. The order in which the information appears is logical and well. In this example they give you a brief overview on the topic before diving in to the different flows and common issues. They layout makes it very easy to navigate through the subsections and makes great use of space on larger displays. Instead of interrupting the reader with snippets they place them off to the side in a separate column which allows you to finish the thought without interruption. The docs are responsive so that if your view port is smaller they collapse that column and give you the standard snippets coupled with the text.
