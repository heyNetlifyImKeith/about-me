### Getting linked up.

I liked the service especially how you guide the user through the process of wiring into your github repo. I did notice that when choosing your build command it might be confusing for non technical users. I think showing the example common build commands by default paired with a "what the heck is this" tooltip with some information might help.

### Some failures and some feedback.

I did have the first few builds fail, which I was not sure of until I went back to the all builds page. Iâ€™m not sure why the status message did not change to Deploy failed initially but it might be helpful to have some kind of color indicator to highlight build status in the card. In general I think success and failures should be more apparent in the card.
